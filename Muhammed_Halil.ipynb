    "We will be using data from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). Visit the NDBC website, https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov, and access some historical data. Take a look at the URL for the data you have accessed: you will need this format to access the data from python.\n",

    "### Part 1: Getting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to save all necessary for your second part here. The following steps are for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `requests` library (or any other similar library at your choice) to download historical Buoy data\n",
    "3. Save all data you downloaded into (a) file(s). If you feel like it, only save that part that is relevant for your second part.\n",
    "4. Use a html parser library (e.g., `BeautifulSoup`, `lxml`, or `html5lib`) to extract the meaning of the data (i.e. what is it measuring and what are the units?). Also save this information somewhere.\n",
    "5. From now on, you don't need to make any more requests to the NDBC website. Only use the data you downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Processing the data\n",
    "6. (Optional) use the `pandas` library to read the data and process as needed, and save the processed data if you want to. Save the processed data\n",
    "7. plot the oceant temperatures (`WTMP`), wave heights (`WVHT`), average wave periods (`APD`), and wind speeds (`WSPD`) going back 10 years or so (some buoys don't have all the data every year)\n",
    "8. Look through `scipy.stats` and choose something like Pearson's or Spearman's correlation test. Determine what (if any) correlations you find between mean ocean temperatures and maximum wave heights or wave periods.\n"
